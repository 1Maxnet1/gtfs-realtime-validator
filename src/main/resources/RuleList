"e002";"stop_time_updates for a given trip_id must be sorted by increasing stop_sequence (this should always be enforced whether or not the feed contains the stop_sequence field). A TripUpdate can have multiple stop_time_updates (e.g., one prediction per stop) - so, this shouldn't be monitored across multiple feed messages, just in a single message."

"e005";"If only delay is provided in a stop_time_event (and not a time), then the GTFS stop_times.txt must contain arrival_times and/or departure_times for all stops referenced in the GTFS-rt feed (i.e., not just timepoints)"

"e007";"If more than more trip_update has the same vehicle_id, then all trips must belong to the same block, and the arrival predictions for each trip must match the sequential order for the trips in the block. For example, if we have trip_ids 1, 2, and 3 that all belong to the same block, and the vehicle trips trip 1, then trip 2, and then trip 3, the arrival predictions should increase chronologically for trips 1, 2, and 3. For example, trip 3 predictions shouldn't be earlier than trip 2 predictions."
"e008";"If a GTFS block (defined by block_id in trips.txt) contains multiple references to the same stopId (i.e., the bus visits the same stopId more than once in the same block), but in different trips, then in the GTFS-rt data the tripId for each TripUpdate.TripDescriptor must be provided. In this case, the bus wouldn't visit the same stopId more than once in the same trip."
"e009";"If a GTFS trip contains multiple references to the same stopId (i.e., the bus visits the same stopId more than once in the SAME trip), then in the GTFS-rt data the stop_sequence for each TripUpdate.StopTimeUpdate must be provided."
